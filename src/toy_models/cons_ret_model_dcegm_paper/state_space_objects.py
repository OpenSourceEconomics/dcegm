    This is very basic in Ishkakov et al (2017).

    Args:
        state (np.ndarray): Array of shape (n_state_variables,) defining the agent's
            state. In Ishkakov, an agent's state is defined by her (i) age (i.e. the
            current period) and (ii) her lagged labor market choice.
            Hence n_state_variables = 2.
        map_state_to_state_space_index (np.ndarray): Indexer array that maps
            a period-specific state vector to the respective index positions in the
            state space.
            The shape of this object is quite complicated. For each state variable it
            has the number of potential states as rows, i.e.
            (n_potential_states_state_var_1, n_potential_states_state_var_2, ....).

    Returns:
        choice_set (np.ndarray): 1d array of length (n_feasible_choices,) with the
            agent's (restricted) feasible choice set in the given state.
