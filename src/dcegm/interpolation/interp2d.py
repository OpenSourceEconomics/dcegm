    The function interpolates by mapping the irregular quadrilateral defined by the grid
    coordinates into a canonical unit square to simplify the interpolation process.

    Note, while the regular grid has a shape of (n_regular_grid_points,) and only
    contains the values of the regular grid, the irregular wealth grid is different
    for each regular grid point. The same is true for the policy and value grids.
    These three objects together define the 2D value and policy functions.
    Hence, each of them has shape (n_regular_grid_points, n_wealth_grid_points).
